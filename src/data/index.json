        "description": " Developed a simulator for the SDLX processor. Implementing a Python-based solution utilizing  libraries such as Numpy and Pandas, translating 32-bit instruction codes into executable program  sequences ensuring accurate execution and output generation through memory-mapped IO. Created a visually appealing user interface using Tkinter, providing a view of system components and  real-time updates. The interface enhanced user interaction and facilitated intuitive control over the  simulator's functionalities. Ensured the reliability of the simulator through comprehensive testing, validation, and error handling  mechanisms. Implemented error reporting features to maintain and facilitate efficient troubleshooting.",
